\title{Calculate the root mean square error for groupings in \code{dataMapping}s}
\usage{
calculateRMSE(dataMappingList, timeDiffThreshold = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataMappingList}{A \code{DataMapping} or a list of \code{DataMapping} objects.}

\item{timeDiffThreshold}{Allowed difference between observed and simulated
time values in minutes. Default is 10. If for a certain observed point no
simulated time point exists within the defined threshold, the value is not
considered.}
}
\value{
Total error for all groups across all provided data mappings.
}
\description{
Calculate the root mean square error for groupings in \code{dataMapping}s
}
\details{
The error is calculated for each group separately and added up. For
each group, the error is defined as the root of the sum of the squared
residuals between each simulated result and observed data.
