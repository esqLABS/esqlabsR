\arguments{
\item{projectConfiguration}{Object of class \code{ProjectConfiguration}
that contains information about the output paths and the excel file
where plots are defined.}

\item{dataCombinedNames}{Names of the DataCombined objects that will be created.

Each data combined used by the specified plot grids will be created. Can be
used together with \code{dataCombinedNames}.}

\item{simulatedScenarios}{A list of simulated scenarios as returned by \code{runScenarios()}}

\item{observedData}{A list of \code{DataSet} objects}

\item{stopIfNotFound}{If TRUE (default), the function stops if any of the
simulated results or observed data are not found. If FALSE a warning is printed.}

\value{
A list of \code{DataCombined} objects, or an empty list if both \code{dataCombinedNames} and \code{plotGridNames} are \code{NULL} or \code{stopIfNotFound = TRUE} and the specified
\code{DataCombined} could not be created.
