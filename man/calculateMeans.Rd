\arguments{
\item{filePath}{full path of a xls/xlsx file containing at least the columns \verb{Patient Id},
\verb{Fraction [\%]} and \verb{Error [\%]}}

\item{saveToOriginalFile}{should the calculated means be written to the original file?}

\description{
Calculate mean and standard deviation for each data set of an excel sheet
}
\details{
Computes mean and standard deviation of \verb{Fraction [\%]} of each subset of data
given by all combinations of values for the other columns.
Results are written to a new file in the original folder per default, if the results shall
be appended to the original file and sheet, the parameter \code{saveToOriginalFile} has to be
set to TRUE. Note that this may take significantly longer as every sheet from the original
file has to be read in first.
