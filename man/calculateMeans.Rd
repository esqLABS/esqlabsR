\usage{
calculateMeans(
  filePath,
  sheet = NULL,
  columnNames = c("Time", "Measurement", "Error"),
  nonGroupingCols = c("Study Id", "Subject Id"),
  saveToOriginalFile = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{filePath}{full path of a xls/xlsx file containing at least the columns \verb{Patient Id},
\verb{Fraction [\%]} and \verb{Error [\%]}}

\item{sheet}{Name or number of the sheet. If \code{NULL} (default), the first sheet of the
file is used.}

\item{columnNames}{vector of length 3, containing names of the columns corresponding
to \code{Time}, \code{Measurement} and \code{Error}, only necessary if they are named differently
in the file e.g. \code{Time [min]} instead of \code{Time}}

\item{nonGroupingCols}{these columns are not used for grouping data into data sets for which
calculations are done.}

\item{saveToOriginalFile}{should the calculated means be written to the original file?}
}
\description{
Calculate mean and standard deviation for each data set of an excel sheet
}
\details{
Computes mean and standard deviation of \code{Measurement} of each subset of data
given by all combinations of values for the other columns (except for \code{nonGroupingCols})
Results are written to a new file in the original folder per default, if the results shall
be appended to the original file and sheet, the argument \code{saveToOriginalFile} has to be
set to TRUE. Note that this may take significantly longer as every sheet from the original
file has to be read in first.
