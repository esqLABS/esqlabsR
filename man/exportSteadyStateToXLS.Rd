  simulation,
  quantitiesPaths = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{simulation}{\code{Simulation} object}

\item{quantitiesPaths}{List of quantity paths (molecules and/or parameters)
for which the steady-state is to be simulated. If \code{NULL} (default), all
molecules and state variable parameters are considered.}

\item{resultsXLSPath}{Path to the xls-file where the results will be written
to. If the file does not exist, a new file is created. If no path is
provided, the file will be created in the same directory where the model
file is located.}

\item{steadyStateTime}{Simulation time (minutes). Must be long enough for
system to reach a steady-state. 1000 by default}

\item{ignoreIfFormula}{If \code{TRUE} (default), species and parameters with
initial values defined by a formula are not included.}

\item{stopIfNotFound}{Boolean. If \code{TRUE} (default), an error is thrown when
results for certain species were not generated. This may happen when due to
numerical problems some values cannot be calculated, though the whole
simulation converges. Setting this argument to \code{FALSE} allows to ignore
such errors. Check the outputs for empty values when using this option.}

\item{lowerThreshold}{Numerical value (in Âµmol). Any steady-state values
below this value are considered as numerical noise and replaced by 0. If
\code{lowerThreshold} is \code{NULL}, no cut-off is applied. Default value is 1e-15.}

Export steady-state to excel

\details{
Simulates a given model to its steady-state and creates an
Excel-file with the end values of molecules amounts in all containers and
parameter values that have a right-hand-side (state variable parameters).
