Sanitize a string to be a valid Excel sheet name
}
\details{
Sanitizes a string to comply with Excel sheet naming rules:
\itemize{
\item Must be 31 characters or less
\item Cannot contain any of these characters: / \ * [ ] : ?
\item Cannot be empty
\item Leading/trailing spaces are trimmed
If the name becomes empty after sanitization, "Sheet" is used as default.
If the name is too long, it's truncated and a suffix may be added to ensure uniqueness.
If warn=TRUE and the name was modified, a warning is issued.
