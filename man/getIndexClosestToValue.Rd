\title{Find value in an array}
\usage{
getIndexClosestToValue(value, array, thresholdAbs = NULL, thresholdRel = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{value}{Numerical value}

\item{array}{Numerical array}

\item{thresholdAbs}{Absolute numerical distance by which the closest value in
\code{array} may differ from \code{value} to be accepted. If both \code{thresholdAbs} and
\code{thresholdRel} are \code{NULL} (default), no threshold is applied. If
\code{thresholdAbs} is set, \code{thresholdRel} is ignored. If 0, only exact match
between \code{value} and \code{array} is accepted.}

\item{thresholdRel}{A fraction by which the closest value may differ from
\code{value} to be accepted. \strong{WARNING}: setting a relative threshold will result
in only exact matches if \code{value} is 0!}
}
\value{
Index of a value within the array which is closest to \code{value} and the
difference is within the defined threshold. If multiple entries of \code{array}
have the same difference which is minimal, a vector of indices is returned.
If no value is within the defined threshold, \code{NULL} is returned.
}
\description{
Find the index of the value in an array that is closest to given
one. By default, no restriction is applied how big the absolute numerical
distance between \code{value} and a value in the \code{array} may be. A limit can be
set by the parameters \code{thresholdAbs} or \code{thresholdRel}. If no value within
the \code{array} has the distance to \code{value} that is equal to or less than the
threshold, the \code{value} is considered not present in the \code{array} and \code{NULL}
is returned.
