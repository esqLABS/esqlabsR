esqlabsR's projects are set up in a four steps process:

1. Initialize Project
2. Design Scenarios
3. Run Simulations
4. Plot Results


While step 1 need to be done just once, you will be able to iterate easily as
you fine tune your simulation and plots using simple code and excel files.

## 1. Project initialization
This first step is to initialize the specific directories and file 
structure required for the workflows.

The output is a `ProjectConfiguration` object that will be used 
in many steps during the rest of the process.

Learn more in `vignette("esqlabsR-project-structure")`.

## 2. Design Scenarios
In esqlabsR, simulations are defined as *scenarios*, which are set up during this
step.

Learn more in `vignette("esqlabsR-design-scenarios")`.

## 3. Run Simulations
After scenarios have been set up, the simulations are run, and the results are returned.

Learn more in `vignette("esqlabsR-run-simulations")`.

## 4. Plot Results
`esqlabsR` implements convenient and automated ways to generate various plots for visual representation of simulation results.
