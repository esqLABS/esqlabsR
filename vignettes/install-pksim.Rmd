The workflows implemented in `{esqlabsR}` rely on functionalities of the
`{ospsuite-r}` package that require
[PK-Sim](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/PK-Sim). It is
necessary that the version of `{ospsuite-r}` matches the version of
PK-Sim. When using the [released
version](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSPSuite-R/releases)
of `{ospsuite-r}`, it is sufficient to install the corresponding [OSPS
release](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Suite/releases).
However, the current version of `{esqlabsR}` relies on features
implemented in the `{ospsuite-r}` and PK-Sim that are still under
development and have not been released. This document describes how to
get the PK-Sim version matching the latest `{ospsuite-r}`.

## Download PK-Sim

Download the latest portable version of PK-Sim by clicking
[here](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/open-systems-pharmacology-ci/pk-sim/artifacts/pk-sim-portable-setup.zip?branch=develop).

## Enable using .dll from zip

Windows Defender prevents applications downloaded from untrusted sources
from being loaded. Before extracting the downloaded portable version,
you have to unblock it.

1.  Right click on the downloaded archive and select "Properties" (on
    Windows 11, you have to select "Show more options" first),
2.  In the Properties-window, select the checkbox "Unblock".

## Restart R session

Make sure that no instance of `{ospsuite}` is loaded. If so, restart the
R session, as otherwise you might not be able to overwrite the existing
portable version of PK-Sim.

## Extract PK-Sim

Extract the downloaded portable PK-Sim to
`C:/Program Files/Open Systems Pharmacology/PK-Sim 12.0`.\
Change the version number in the folder name to match the PK-Sim version
you downloaded while keeping only the two digits. For example, if you
downloaded PK-Sim 12.0.1, the folder name should be `PK-Sim 12.0`.
