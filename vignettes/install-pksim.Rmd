## Download PK-Sim

Download the latest portable version of PK-Sim by clicking
[here](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/open-systems-pharmacology-ci/pk-sim/artifacts/pk-sim-portable-setup.zip?branch=develop).

## Enable using .dll from zip

Windows Defender prevents applications downloaded from untrusted sources from
being loaded. Before extracting the downloaded portable version, you have to
unblock it.
  
1.  Right click on the downloaded archive and select "Properties" (on
    Windows 11, you have to select "Show more options" first),
2.  In the Properties-window, select the checkbox "Unblock".

## Restart R session

Make sure that no instance of `{ospsuite}` is loaded. If so, restart the R session,
as otherwise you might not be able to overwrite the existing portable version of
PK-Sim.

## Extract PK-Sim

Extract the downloaded portable PK-Sim to `C:/Program Files/Open Systems
Pharmacology/PK-Sim 12.0`.   
Change the version number in the folder name to 
match the PK-Sim version you downloaded while keeping only the two digits. For 
example, if you downloaded PK-Sim 12.0.1, the folder name should be `PK-Sim 12.0`.
