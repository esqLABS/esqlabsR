Within the `esqlabsR` framework, the simulations are run by defining and
executing multiple *scenarios*. A scenario is defined by the simulation
file containing the model structure, parametrization of the model,
application protocol, and (optionally) the physiology of the simulated
individual or population. To simplify scenarios set up, all this
information is stored in Excel files with a defined structure.

The step-wise approach of setting up a new simulation scenario is shown
in Figure 1; a detailed description of the Excel file structures and `R`
code are given in the [Configuration files structure](#files-structure)
section.

![Figure 1: Workflow of scenario setup](Figures/ScenarioWorkflow.png)

## Add a new scenario

### 1. Add the model file

After the model has been developed in PK-Sim and/or MoBi, a simulation
must be stored as a *.pkml* file in the `Models/Simulations` folder.

### 2. Name the new scenario

To set up a simulation/scenario in `R`, open the file `Scenarios.xlsx`
located in the folder `Parameters`. Start defining a scenario by giving
it a *name* in the `Scenario_name` column. The scenario name will be
used later to retrieve simulation results, e.g., in figure definitions.

### 3. Link to the model file

Specify the simulation `*.pkml` file to use in the column `ModelFile`.

If you want to run the simulation with the settings as it has been
exported from PK-Sim or MoBi, you can proceed to
`vignette("esqlabsR-run-simulations")`.

## Customize a scenario

### 4. Simulation Parameters

You can define simulation parameters in the `ModelParameters.xlsx` file.
To apply them to the simulation, you need to specify which sheets to
load in the `ModelParameterSheets` column of the `Scenarios.xlsx` file.

### 5. Individuals

If you want to simulate a specific individual with individual
characteristics (age, weight, etc.) or apply individual model parameter
values to the simulation, define the individual in the `IndividualId`
column. Then create a new individual entry in the `Individuals.xlsx`
file.

a)  To create a new individual with specific biometrics, create a new
    row in the `IndividualBiometrics` sheet.
b)  To define an individual-specific parametrization, create a new sheet
    and name it as the individual's ID.

### 6. Population

To run a *population simulation*, specify a population in the column
`PopulationId`. If you want to create a new population each time you run
the scenario, define population demographics in the `Demographics` sheet
of the `PopulationParameters.xlsx` file. Remember that simulation
results might differ each time you run the scenario, as a new population
will be generated each time!

If you want to import a population from an existing CSV file, set the
value of the `ReadPopulationFromCSV` column to `TRUE`. The population
CSV file must be located in the `Parameters/Populations` folder.

### 7. Time

Simulation time can also be changed with the `SimulationTime` and
`SimulationTimeUnit` columns.

### 8. OutputPath

You can define the outputs of the simulation in the `OutputPathsIds`
column. For convenience, not the full paths to the outputs must be
listed, but their acronyms. The full path for each acronym must be
defined in the sheet `OutputPaths`.

### 9. Administration Protocols

Finally, you can simulate different administration protocols from the
same simulation file by defining an application protocol in the column
`ApplicationProtocol`. See the description below.

Now that you designed your own simulation, read
`vignette("esqlabsR-run-simulations")` to continue the process. To learn
more about simulation design, read the following sections.

## Details

### Configuration files structure {#files-structure}

The relevant Excel files for the definition of the scenarios are:

-   `ApplicationParameters.xlsx`
-   `Individuals.xlsx`
-   `ModelParameters.xlsx`
-   `PopulationParameters.xlsx`
-   `Scenarios.xlsx`

The `Scenarios` sheet of the `Scenarios.xlsx` file has the following
structure:

#### Scenario_name

Unique name of the scenario. The name must be a [valid R variables
name](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#What-are-valid-names_003f).

#### IndividualId

Name (ID) of an individual. This name refers to the name of the
individual as used in Excel file `Individuals.xlsx` for the definition
of the biometric properties (sheet `IndividualBiometrics`) of the
simulated individual individual-specific model parameters. For the
latter, create a separate sheet in the `Individuals.xlsx` files with the
sheet name being the `IndividualId`. The structure of these sheets is
the same as the structure of the sheets in the `ModelParameter.xlsx`
file, see description below. **IndividualId** may be empty. In this
case, the individual as defined in the `pkml` simulation without any
individual-specific model parameters will be simulated. The same
individual can be used in multiple scenarios. It is possible to scale
from a human model to the species **Rat**, **Rabbit**, and **Monkey** by
applying the respective individual to the simulation. Other species
scalings are technically possible but the correctness of the results is
not guaranteed as there exist some structural differences between the
species.

#### PopulationId

Name (ID) of a population. If empty, the scenario is simulated as an
individual simulation. Otherwise, population simulation is performed. If
the column **ReadPopulationFromCSV** is set to `FALSE`, **PopulationId**
refers to the name of the population as defined in the sheet
`Demographics` of the file `PopulationParameters.xlsx`. To create a
population with specific demographic characteristics, define an entry
with the same population id in the `Demographics`. The same population
can be used in multiple scenarios. If the column
**ReadPopulationFromCSV** is set to `TRUE`, the population will be
imported from the CSV file located in the folder
`Parameters/Populations`, the name of the file must be the id of the
population. **Note**: You can define both an **IndividualId** and a
**PopulationId**. In this case, individual-specific parameters from the
`IndividualParameters.xlsx` will be applied to the simulation before
applying the population parameters. Keep in mind, that any physiological
parameters defined for an individual that are also part of the parameter
set of a population will be overwritten by the population! If, e.g., you
specify the GFR of the individual in the `IndividualParameters.xlsx`, it
will be overwritten by the GFR values sampled in the simulation.

#### ModelParameterSheets

A list of sheet names from the `ModelParameter.xlsx` file, separated by
a `,`. Each sheet must contain `Container Path`, `Parameter Name`,
`Value`, and `Units`. Parameter values from specified sheets will be
applied to the model according to the order of their definition. E.g.,
if we define `Global, Aciclovir`, then parameters from the `Aciclovir`
sheet will be applied after the `Global` parameters.
**ModelParameterSheets** may be empty or specify as many sheets as
required. Note that the specified sheets must be present in the
`ModelParameter.xlsx` file. This approach aims to have *global*
parameters that can be applied to most scenarios and a separate set of
parameters for, e.g., different *disease states* (parameter sheets
`Healthy` and `CKD`) or separate parametrization of different
*compounds* (sheet `Aciclovir`).\
You can further refine the parametrization of the scenario by specifying
the individual parameters in the `IndividualParameters.xlsx` file.
Create a sheet with the name as the *IndividualId* specified for the
respective scenario with the same structure as the
`ModelParameters.xlsx` file. This way, you can define, e.g.,
individual-specific clearance values or, as in the example case, the
glomerular filtration rate. Individual-specific parameters are applied
after the parameters defined in the *ModelParameterSheets*. You can use
an individual in multiple scenarios. This step is ignored if an
individual is specified in the scenario definition, but no sheet with
this name exists in the IndividualParameters.xlsx file.

#### ApplicationProtocol

Name of the application protocol that will be applied. Applications are
defined as parameters that will be applied to the model in the file
`ApplicationParameters.xlsx`. For each application, create a sheet with
the name as specified in the **ApplicationProtocol** entry and populate
it with the same structure as the `ModelParameter.xlsx` file.
Configuring application protocols this way requires that the loaded
simulation includes all possible applications that can be turned on and
off by setting parameters, e.g., the `Dose` or `Start time` parameters.
As it might be cumbersome to create entries for all administration
parameters manually, we can use the getAllApplicationParameters()
function to get a list of all (constant) parameters in the
`Applications` container. In the following example, we will extract
application parameters for the molecule `Aciclovir` from the example
simulation:

```{r}
sim <- loadSimulation(system.file("extdata", "Aciclovir.pkml", package = "ospsuite"))
applicationParams <- getAllApplicationParameters(sim)
print(applicationParams)
```

And export the parameters to an Excel file using the
`exportParametersToXLS()` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
exportParametersToXLS(parameters = applicationParams, paramsXLSpath = "../Applications.xlsx")
```

The created Excel file will have the same structure as all
Parameter-files and can be directly loaded in MoBi or R using the
`readParametersFromXLS()` function.

#### SimulationTime

Time of the simulation. Multiple simulation time intervals can be
defined, each being a triplet of \<StartTime, EndTime, Resolution\>
values. Resolution is the number of simulated points per time unit
defined in the column `TimeUnit`. Simulation intervals are separated by
a `;`.

For example, to simulate the model for 10 minutes with a resolution of 1
point per minute, the value of the column `SimulationTime` should be
`0, 10, 1`, and that of the column `SimulationTimeUnit` should be `min`.
To simulate the model for \* 20 hours with a resolution of 1 point per
minute, then \* for three weeks (equals to 3*7*24 = 504 hours) with a
resolution of 1 point per hour, and finally \* for two days (equals to
504 + 2\*24 = 552 hours) with a resolution of 10 points per hour,

the value of the column `SimulationTime` should be
`0, 20, 60; 20, 504, 1; 504, 552, 10`, and that of the column
`SimulationTimeUnit` should be `h`.

#### SimulationTimeUnit

Unit for `SimulationTime`. For supported units, see
`ospsuite::ospUnits`.

#### SteadyState

If `TRUE`, the model will be simulated for a "sufficiently long" time
(1000 minutes by default).

#### SteadyStateTime

Time for the steady state.

#### SteadyStateTimeUnit

Unit for `SteadyStateTime`. For supported units, see
`ospsuite::ospUnits`.

#### ModelFile

Name of the `pkml` file with the simulation. It must be located in the
folder defined in `ProjectConfiguration$modelFolder`.

#### OutputPathsIds

Paths of model outputs (i.e., paths to the molecules/ parameters for
which outputs will be simulated) can be defined in the sheet
`OutputPaths`. Create an entry for each output path by entering the full
path into the column `OutputPath` and defining a unique identifier for
this path in the column `OutputPathId`. The content of the sheet could
look like this:

| OutputPathId       | OutputPath                                                                   |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Aciclovir_PVB      | Organism\|PeripheralVenousBlood\|Aciclovir\|Plasma (Peripheral Venous Blood) |
| Aciclovir_fat_cell | Organism\|Fat\|Intracellular\|Aciclovir\|Concentration in container          |

In the `Scenarios` sheet, enter the IDs of all paths the outputs should
be generated for, separated by a comma, e.g.,
`Aciclovir_PVB, Aciclovir_fat_cell`.

### Scenario parameterization hierarchy

The final parameterization combines the different parameterization steps
defined at various levels, as described in the section above. The
following figure summarizes the hierarchy of the parameterization.

![Parametrization sequence](Figures/ParametrizationHierarchy.png)

If a parameter path is defined in multiple steps, its value will be
overwritten by the subsequent steps. That means individual parameter
values will overwrite the values defined in the "ModelParameters.xlsx"
file, and parameters specified in the `customParams` argument of the
`runScenarios()` function will overwrite everything else.

The order of parameter sheets of the "ModelParameters.xlsx" file defined
in the **ModelParameterSheets** column defines the order in which the
parameters are applied.

<!-- For demonstrating the simulation design process, we will use the example included in the package (which can be accessed using `example_ProjectConfiguration`). It models the administration of a single dose of 250 mg aciclovir intravenously to an individual with a 90 ml/min estimated glomerular filtration rate. -->
