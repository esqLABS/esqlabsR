## Object-oriented approach

The `{esqlabsR}` package utilizes the concept of object-oriented (OO) programming based on the [R6 system](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/r6.html). While the philosophy of the package is to offer a functional programming workflow more common for the R users, it is important to understand some basic concepts of the OO programming. Many of the functions implemented in `{esqlabsR}` return an *instance* (or an *object*) of a *class*. These objects can be used as inputs fopkgr other methods. Additionally, each object offers a set of properties (which can be other objects) and methods, which are accessible by the `$` character:

```r
# create an instance of an object
object1 <- ClassName$new()

# extract a property associated with this object
aProperty <- object1$property1

# apply a method associated with this object
resultOfAFunction <- object1$multiply(1,2)
```

Important information about the object can be printed out by calling `print(object)`.
