The esqlabsR packages comes with two Shiny apps: the Function Visualizer and the Unit Converter app. They are run by the commands `startFunctionVisualizer()` and `startUnitConverter()`, which will open a new window with a graphical user interface.

### Function Visualizer

The **Function Visualizer** allows users to easily plot a chosen  mathematical 
function for different parameter values and add any data points for comparison.

The function can be entered in the *Equation* field. It must be defined according to R syntax and can include standard arithmetic operators `-`, `+`, `*`, `/`, `%%` and `%/%` as well as the functions `exp`, `log`, `sin`, `exp`, `cos`, `tan`, `sqrt`, `floor`, `ceiling` and the constant `pi`. After setting the function, 
the user must select the argument (the *independent variable*) in the *Argument* 
field and define (constant) values for each remaining parameter (either by slider or in 
the respective *current* input field). The curve for the current parameter settings can be permanently added to the output plot (*Add snapshot* button) to compare it to other parameter settings. You can zoom in on the plot by changing the *axis limits*.

Data points can be added to the graph in the *Add single points to plot* section below the plot, they will be displayed by `+` symbol in the output. Another option for adding multiple data points at once is by uploading data from a xls/xlsx file. The columns for the x and y values, as well as a label for the data to appear in the legend of the plot, can be chosen in a pop-up window.

### Unit Converter

The **Unit Converter** app provides a graphical interface for use of the [
toUnit()](https://www.open-systems-pharmacology.org/OSPSuite-R/reference/toUnit.html) function. 
First, choose the Dimension from the dropdown menu, then, choose the input and 
output units, and type in the value to be converted. The tool also allows to 
convert `Concentration` to `Amount` quantities, e. g. from `mol/l` to `mg/l`. 
For that, a molecular weight value in `g/mol` must be provided in the respective 
field. In all other cases, this field is deactivated.
