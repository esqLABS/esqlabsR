The **`{esqlabsR}`** R-package is designed to facilitate and standardize **modeling and simulation** (M&S) of PBPK and QSP models implemented in [Open Systems Pharmacology Software](https://www.open-systems-pharmacology.org/) (OSPS) and executed from R. The package provides functions to read and run scenarios, workflows and simulations and create plots and visualization based on no-code input from Excel files. The package is based on R functions in the [`ospsuite` package](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSPSuite-R).


## Motivation

This package builds up on the functionality of the `{ospsuite}` package. It is strongly recommended to get familiar with the [R Introduction](https://docs.open-systems-pharmacology.org/working-with-r/introduction-ospsuite-r) section of the OSPS manual.

In order to load a simulation in R, it must be present in the **\*.pkml** file format. Every simulation in PK-Sim or MoBi can be exported to the *.pkml file. The examples shown in this documentation are based on the Aciclovir example model, until stated otherwise. The model can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Example_Aciclovir) as PK-Sim project. The pkml file can be downloaded from [ospsuite-r](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSPSuite-R/blob/develop/inst/extdata/Aciclovir.pkml) repository.

The articles below covers several aspects of the software usage:

## Object-oriented approach

The `{esqlabsR}` package utilizes the concept of object-oriented (OO) programming based on the [R6 system](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/r6.html). While the philosophy of the package is to offer a functional programming workflow more common for the R users, it is important to understand some basic concepts of the OO programming. Many of the functions implemented in `{esqlabsR}` return an *instance* (or an *object*) of a *class*. These objects can be used as inputs for other methods. Additionally, each object offers a set of properties (which can be other objects) and methods, which are accessible by the `$` sign:

```r
# create an instance of an object
object1 <- ClassName$new()

# extract a property associated with this object
aProperty <- object1$property1

# apply a method associated with this object
resultOfAFunction <- object1$multiply(1,2)
```

Important information about the object can be printed out by calling `print(object)`.
