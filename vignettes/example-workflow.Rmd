This package offers a workflow for creating standardized figures for time-values data, such as time-concentration profiles, goodness-of-fit plots, etc. The integral part of these workflows are the objects of the class `DataMapping`. A `DataMapping` organizes the objects of the class `XYData` (see [Data handling](data-handling.html) for more information) into groups and maps simulation results to observed data.

## `DataMapping` overview
